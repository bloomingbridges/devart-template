That's it, I'm throwing in the towel. The generated wurst meshes aren't anywhere near printable, I should have picked a primitive and start manipulating it, informed by the normals or some other values extracted from the original meshes.

The biggest bummer is not the file dialog being broken, but rather that I didn't find enough time to develop this project. It was certainly not _pushing_ any boundaries and it was intentionally NOT web-based, but as I wrote before I just needed to do this for myself.

Thanks __Google__ for this opportunity, it fills my heart with regret not being able to deliver this project in time. My hope is that at least one of you will chuckle at the idea of turning data into sausages. 

In addition to this one, I will open another dedicated repository for __Meshwurst__ with proper attributions and license, where eventually I (or someone else) might invest some more hours into wrapping it up.
