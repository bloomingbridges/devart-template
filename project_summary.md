## Description

__Meshwurst__ allows you to send virtual geometry into the grinder and turn them into "digital sausages", ready for the 3D printer. Taking inspiration from glitch art, I want to explore means of creating such by-products by safely manipulating vertices rather than corrupting the data itself. The transformation of representational as well as non-representational meshes pose   questions over their life-spans and value.
